//! A module for sample generators
//!
//! The `sample_gen` module is used to define sample generators
//! a Sample generator is a unit that produce samples, synced to a clock,
//! given a SmartBuffer using and custom sampling engine.
//! There is many ways to playback audio phrases and snap it to a clock (could be internal / external clock).
//! It invloves some form of time compression / expansion with respect to original tempo in which the phrase was recorded originally.
//! 
//! Thoses are researched so far: 
//! - RePitch uses a simple linear interpolation. Cubic and Quadratic don't worth the CPU cycles.
//! - Sliced acts more like a beat slicer Ã  la ReCycle.
//! - PVoc uses TimeStretching from the Phase Vocoder implemented in Aubio.
